## The checkPoint group contains settings to configure capture of a sample
#checkPoint:

## The task to sample on. The format of a task is "Configuration_Name.Task_Name"
#  task: PLC_1.Main

## Whether to check the value before or after the task (default: after)
#  position: after

## The rate at which to capture samples on the checkPoint (Default: 1)
#frequency: 1

## PERPETUAL JOB ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS

## The number of samples that can be kept in the job's internal storage
bufferCount: 10000

## FINITE JOB ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS

## The desired number of samples for the job
# sampleCount: 1000

## Configurations related to creating a trigger
#saveTrigger:

## The condition for the trigger (see https://console.simatic-ax.siemens.io/docs/tracing/configuration-file#condition-construction)
#  condition: Tag1 = 50

## The number of samples to retain from before the trigger condition is met
#  preSamples: 5

## Configurations for persisting measurements on the memory card
#memoryCard:

## The number of measurements to store before the job is complete
#  saveCount: 5

## Tell the job to continue running after hitting the saveCount, and overwrite the oldest measurement with the newest one.
#  overwriteWhenFull: false
